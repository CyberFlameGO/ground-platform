## Submitting code

Before starting work on a change, comment on one of the [open issues](https://github.com/google/ground-platform/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
saying you'd like to take it on. If one does not exist, you can also
[create one here](https://github.com/google/ground-platform/issues/new).

Once an issue has been assigned to you, you may start writing your own code.
The first time you contribute, be sure to must [create a fork](https://github.com/google/ground-platform/fork)
