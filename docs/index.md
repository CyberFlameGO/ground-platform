Ground is an open source, map-first data collection platform that enables users
to collect, map, and share data, even when a stable internet connection isn't
guaranteed. The Ground team, made up of volunteers at Google and contributors
from the open source community, aspires to empower local communities,
researchers, NGOs, and other interest groups to collect data that matters.

**Note:** Ground is not an officially supported Google product, and is developed
on a best-effort basis. If you would like to contribute to Ground development,
see the [Contribute](#contribute) section. If you have questions or ideas about
Ground that you'd like to share, post them to the
[ground-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ground-discuss) discussion group.

# Features

*   **Flexible Data Collection**: Raster basemaps, photo, audio, and video
    attachments, custom forms and data validation, and other features,
    make Ground a great tool for collecting geospatial data on a wide range of
    domains. You can tune Ground to meet your needs, whether you're tracking
    malaria outbreaks or mapping animal habitats.

*   **Community Engagement**: Use Ground to foster interest, trust, and
    participation with local and global communities. Crowd-sourcing features
    provide a means leveraging local knowledge at a large scale to produce
    otherwise inaccessible insights.

*   **Offline First**: Mobility is crucial when collecting or verifying data in
    remote areas. Ground's offline mobile data collection and offline
    raster basemaps give users uninterrupted access to important data wherever
    they may be. Intelligent background data sync automatically uploads new
    data when an internet connection is available.

*   **Remeasurement**: Ground's unique data collection model doesn't only allow
    collection of data in space, but also allows remeasurement of observations
    over time and/or by multiple users. Map and monitor glacial movements,
    community growth, algae levels, and other dynamic data points.

# Use Cases

It's the Ground team's mission to make Ground adaptable to a broad range of
humanitarian, data-intensive, and geospatial use cases, such as:

*   **Environmental Conservation**: Environmental organizations and
    conservationists can use Ground to capture ecological data, map migration
    routes or habitats, and discover and mitigate the effects of environmental
    change.

*   **Resource Management**: Using Ground, communities can manage resources in
    conditions of scarcity, such as droughts or food shortages. Individuals can
    report on the status of shared infrastructure, and relief and recovery teams
    can assess and determine the best distribution of available aid.

*   **Social Analysis**: Sociologists and students can use Ground to collect and
    analyze population data, community growth, and other social factors.
    Researchers can use Ground to encourage the direct participation of
    communities in the research process.

*   **Civic Engagement**: Ground can enhance civic participation by equipping
    policy makers, community groups, and institutions with the data they need to
    assess public sentiment and enact change. Civic organizations can use
    Ground to facilitate civic engagement, poll citizenry, and analyze the
    political landscape.

*   **Traditional Knowledge Preservation** Using Ground, indigenous communities
    can record place-based traditional knowledge, skills, and practices. Ground
    empowers stewards of tradition to incorporate sites of cultural and natural
    signifigance into land mangement and community development decisions.
    Researchers can use Ground to augment their collaborations with community
    knowledge experts on field trips and during interviews.
