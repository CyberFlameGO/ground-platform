# Ground Cloud Components

This project consists of three cloud-based components, each in their own respective subdirectories:

* web: The Ground web UI
* functions: Firebase Cloud Functions used to sync with Google Sheets and other data sources
* firestore: Configuration for Ground's main Firestore instance

At present, Polymer only supports Nodejs 8.0+, while Firstore Cloud Functions only supports v6.11.5. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory listed above for setting up the dev environment.
